This is my portfolio for CMU's Telling Stories With Data Class.

# About Me
My name is Samantha, but I go by Sam, and my pronouns are she/her/hers. I am a second-year student in the Master of Arts Management program. I'm originally from Jacksonville, FL, and went to Florida State University for International Affairs and English (I know, random combination and fairly unrelated to the MAM program) right before moving to Pittsburgh last year. I grew up doing theatre and dance, and I hope to work in development or marketing for a theatre or dance organization after graduating from CMU. Other fun facts about me: I studied abroad in Prague, have the cutest chihuahua-daschund mix back home in Florida, and am obsessed with desserts.

# What I Hope to Learn
I haven't had any advanced experience with data visualization before coming to this class (I consider "advanced" to be anything beyond simple Excel charts). I hope to learn how to create more captivating data visualizations that showcase data in a way that also sends a message, or tells a story. Data is really important for decision-making in the arts, and I hope to gain skills in this course that can help me create and present data effectively in my future career.
