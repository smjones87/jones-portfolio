# Part III 

## [Final Project Shorthand Link](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/protecting-lgtbq-youth-from-conversion--therapy-/index.html)

## Changes Made

I changed nearly every data visualization from my Part II wireframes after receiving feedback from my peers. I received mixed feedback on the placement of the timeline of LGBTQ rights in the story, but the majority agreed that it was a good set-up for the main argument of the story. Because my audience is LGBTQ people and LGBTQ allies, I assumed that most people would be familiar with the major laws enacted in the United States regarding LGBTQ rights. I still wanted to provide a brief summary to show just how recently they have gone into place, though, and set the stage for one major protection that is missing: conversion "therapy." When working in Shorthand and other visualization tools, I found that the easiest way to create a timeline like I imagined in my wireframes would be to use Canva or Infogram, but I wasn't happy with how they were visually presented in Shorthand so I opted for the simpler presentation of just text. In another round of user research asking the same peers that reviewed my wireframes, people suggested breaking it up with bars and bolding the years to create some text hierarchy, which I did.

One of my biggest issues in Part II was the infograph I created using icons of people. I used Infogram to make two different visualizations, one for each statistic. These revised visualizations received much better feedback. I also added in supporting text, defining conversion "therapy" and introducing the main opposing arguments for and against it.

The next visualization, showing the prevalence of depression and suicide among high school students based on sexual orientation, was completely new based on data I found after completing Part II. The data I was using for my earlier visualization that I replaced, comparing statistics of suicide attempts based on whether or not the person had received conversion "therapy", was too confusing. The data came from the Trevor Project Survey, but I couldn't access the raw data to be able to successfully revise the bar graph from Part II and make sense of it. Instead, I used this CDC report to compare the prevalence of suicide between high schoolers that identified as heterosexual, gay, lesbian, or bisexual, and those that were unsure of their sexual orientation. While this data excludes transgender youth and doesn't directly correlate to conversion "therapy", it shows how LGB youth are already at a much higher risk for mental health issues and suicide, which conversion "therapy" would exacerbate. This visualization translated much better for my peers who gave feedback.

The next visualization of call out statistics showing how suicide attempts and depression increases for those subjected to the practice, stayed the same from Part II, I simply used Canva to manipulate the text how I wanted and used it as an image in Shorthand.

The map was also significantly altered since Part II. I had a few people share in that round of user feedback that they wished to see more detailed information as opposed to simply which states had banned conversion "therapy" and which didn't. I was able to pinpoint states that have introduced such legislation and give them a separate color, and find even more specific data on how local ordinances protect some LGBTQ youth. Taking advantage of the regions and points sections of the Flourish map was really helpful. My peers liked this final map much better because it shows more data and tells a more nuanced story. I also want to make a note about one thing that may not be clear without further explanation (which I omitted in the presentation due to time) - North Carolina is categorized as partially protecting LGBTQ youth through state legislation because their law bans federal funding for conversion "therapy", but not necessarily the practice.

My final visualization, the donut chart of who provides conversion "therapy" was also a Part III addition. I found this data and felt it was important to include to show that even though there are legal changes, there needs to be more because those that exist have loopholes for religious figures that are most often the culprits. My final user research showed that it was a powerful ending and transition to the call to action.

I slightly altered the call to action, mainly in the way it was presented in Shorthand, to show the priority of conversion "therapy"-specific actions, as well as broader resources for the audience.

## Reflection

While I had a basic knowledge of some of this information, I learned a lot through the phases of this project. Not only did the data I found really open my eyes to the issues at hand, but I was able to test and see how different methods of data visualization either helped the story or didn't. The most surprising finds for me were the two visualizations I added after Part II, the donut chart and grouped column chart. The grouped column chart made it exceptionally clear how at risk LGBTQ youth are for depression and suicide, which is extremely alarming and heartbreaking. The donut chart also really showed how the laws aren't protecting nearly as many people as they are intended to. The research and visualization tools used were really interesting for me to learn from and I am excited to use these skills I've taken away in the future.
