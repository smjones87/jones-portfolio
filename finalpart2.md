# Part II

## Wireframes/Storyboards

I utilized Balsamiq's wireframing tool to create my wireframes/storyboards. I used the wireframing elements to draft data visualizations, and I also included a visualization I had already created using Flourish. I built it out to really be a blueprint for when I transfer everything into Shorthand, including titles, subtitles, and text that tells the narrative alongside the visualizations. The PDF is attached below.

## User Research

To get feedback, I shared my wireframes/storyboards with a few classmates and received many helpful critiques from five different people. I sent them the wireframes/storyboards along with a Google form for them to anonymously respond to my questions. The ages of those that responded are between 20-35, and a couple of them also identify as LGBTQ. The target audience of my project is LGBTQ allies of all ages and backgrounds, but it was also important to me to see how the story resonated with those in the LGBTQ community as well.

|Goal                     |Questions Asked                                         |Feedback
|Emotional appeal         |What is your initial reaction to the story?             |The majority of respondents were shocked and worried about the reality regarding the detrimental effects of conversion therapy on LGBTQ youth. Some respondents were more familiar with the subject than others, but reported that they learned more about how wide spread the issue is and gained a new perspective.
|Clarity of narrative     |Does the flow of information make sense?                |Most respondents said the information was clear and the flow of the narrative made sense. One suggested that the timeline is moved to before or after the map so that the information about legislation is all together, and that the presentation begins with the problem. Another suggested that I use the map as a transition into the call to action by adding more direct text.
|Empowerment              |Would you take action after seeing this presentation? If so, is there a specific action you feel more drawn to?    |Respondents were more drawn to The Trevor Project and Born Perfect because of their missions specific towards LGBTQ youth; the majority also mentioned that they had not heard of Born Perfect before and were interested in that organization. Respondents that identify as LGBTQ were less compelled by HRC and ACLU because they are larger, broader organizations. One respondent noted their appreciation for the layout, placing more grassroots-funded organizations on top, and another suggested I guide the reader to the call of action best suited for them. 
|Complete information     |Is there any information you feel is left out, or unnecessary information that you would remove? |Most respondents skipped this question, but one suggested that I include information about states that may be considering legislation protecting LGBTQ youth from conversion therapy.
|Effective visualizations |Do you think the data visualizations aid the narrative? Is there anything you would change about them? |Nearly all respondents struggled with the visualization using icons of people to represent two different statistics, stating that it took them a significant amount of time to understand it. There was also some confusion with the bar graphs and what exact information was being compared. Two respondents also noted that they liked the consistency of the use of blue.

After reading through this feedback, it is evident to me that the narrative and message of my project is strong, but a couple of the visualizations definitely need some work. I plan to change the icon graph of people, probably splitting it into two different charts to show the two different statistics. I will also alter the side-by-side bar graph, changing a lot of its elements to make the information and visualization more clear. I will also consider rearranging some elements of the story, and at the very least fill out the subtitles and text to make the story more complete, and use callouts with text formatting to draw the readers attention to valuable information within that text.
