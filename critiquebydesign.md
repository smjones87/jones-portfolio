## Alumni Reflect on College Responsiveness to Sexual Assault

### Original Visualization
![Original Table](2020-11-14 .png)
I found this visualization in a [Gallup news article](https://news.gallup.com/poll/311675/alumni-reflect-college-responsiveness-sex-assault.aspx) titled "Alumni Reflect on College Responsiveness to Sexual Assault" by Stephanie Marken. The article discusses the confidence levels of college alumni on how likely they believe their alma maters would be to fully investigate any sexual assault claims. The article uses this table to compare confidence levels between female and male alumni as well as LGBT alumni versus non-LGBT alumni; the article includes another table dividing data into public and private university alumni.
