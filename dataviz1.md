## Analysis and Explanation
The three visualizations are very different. I really like the functionality of OECD's bar chart; it allows the viewer to compare the debt-to-GDP ratio of a single year, and it is easy to determine which countries have the highest and lowest ratios by glancing at the height of the bars. It is also helpful to be able to hover over the bars to see the specific percentage for a specific country. The monochromatic color scheme also makes it easy to distinguish the bars from the background as well as the highlighted bars.

The line charts grid serves a different purpose, it allows the viewer to compare the trend of each individual country's ratio over time. It's more difficult to distinguish the specific percentages and specific years, but it is easy to see where the debt-to-GDP ratio rises and falls over time. Because it is a grid of line charts, it is more difficult to compare specific ratios between different countries.

In my last visualization, my goal was to make it easier to compare the trend lines of debt-to-GDP ratios over time between countries. I decided to highlight the United States with the color red (the specific red from the flag), and make the other countries' lines gray so that the viewer can make comparisons between the U.S. and other countries. Although the graph is busy with all of the lines, countries can be deselected in the legend if the viewer only wants to compare the U.S. to certain countries. The brief description underneath the title also reinforces that the intent of the visualization is for the viewer to compare the U.S.' debt to that of other countries around the world.

The data source for all three graphs is [OECD](https://data.oecd.org/gga/general-government-debt.htm)
