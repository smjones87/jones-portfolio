# Final Project

## Part I

### Outline

The data I am using focuses on the rights of LGBTI people across the world; which countries have laws protecting LGBTI people and various rights, as well as which countries have laws criminalizing LGBTI people for their sexual orientation. Part of the audience is LGBTI people, but I really want to focus on appealing to people who identify as or claim to be allies to the LGBTQIA community, but are not as educated on the subject of LGBTI human rights around the world. While this data covers information from many countries, I want to focus on the audience in the United States, and point out where the United States is both ahead of the curve with LGBTI protections and where it is falling behind. The story arc will begin with highlighting legal protections that exist for the LGBTI community, then go down for what criminalizations exist, show where countries have and don't have these protections, then finally will show the audience how to advocate for more human rights protections. In the current political climate, I have found that many people want to educate themselves on marginalized groups and take more action to support those groups, but have a hard time confronting biases and pushing through personal barriers to really make change and be a true ally. As a member of the LGBTQ community, I am very passionate about the subject and interested in learning about these human rights on an international scale. 

One sentence summary: There are many countries that still criminalize the LGBTI community and fail to protect it; the United States and others need more advocacy for human rights for this group.

Reader statement: As a reader, I want to know where in the world the LGBTI community are harmed, so that I can advocate better and support the cause.

Call to action: Use your voice to advocate for LGBTI rights in the United States and internationally, and if you can, donate to organizations that support these efforts.

### Initial Sketches

![Maps](/initial_maps.jpg)
These maps are obviously inaccurate, but give a general idea of the main ideas in this data: where countries have enacted laws protecting the LGBTI community, and where countries have criminalized the LGBTI community. This is basically what ILGA World's own maps show, and the maps that I make will provide a starting place for the story.

![Charts](/initial_charts.jpg)
These charts are also inaccurate, but show how many opportunities there are in this dataset to show more specific comparisons and tell more specific and compelling stories. I am considering comparing specific helpful and harmful laws across the world, possibly divided by continents, and also showing a global picture of proportions of countres that have certain laws in place. I believe through creating individual visualizations for different points in the data, I will be able to tell a more robust story than I would with only maps.

### Data

The data source is The International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association, or [ILGA World](https://ilga.org/). I initially found [this dataset](ILGA_data.xlsx) through [Data World](https://data.world/dataforacause/lgbt-laws) and explored the data there. It is from 2017, and includes a variety of laws in 163 countries regarding protection, criminalization, recognition, and rights of LGBTI people across the world. More specifically, the data identifies countries where gay or lesbian relationships are illegal, where age of consent is unequal, where sexual acts are punishable at maximum sentences, where LGBTI people can be prosecuted for immorality up to a maximum sentence, how long maximum sentences are, whether or not human rights organizations are involved, where LGBTI marriage and adoption is recognized and legal, and where there are protections against conversion therapy, for employment, and against hate crimes. After doing more research into ILGA World, I found that they have datasets available for [2016, 2017, and 2019](https://ilga.org/maps-sexual-orientation-laws) as well as maps that visualize where there are stronger protections or more criminalization laws. I decided to stick with the 2017 data rather than the 2019 data because the way it is formatted, it is much easier to work with in Tableau, but I will reference the more recent dataset and look for changes too. Although the organization already has a variety of different maps to represent the data, I want to go further than that with other kinds of visualizations to tell the story and get the audience to my call to action. 

### Method and Medium

I plan to use Shorthand to create and format my final project as well as my final presentation. After looking through the data more in-depth, I will create more robust sketches and will likely use the Balsamiq wireframing tool, before going to Tableau to create my visualizations.

## Part I Revision

### Outline

After receiving feedback on Part I and beginning to work through Part II, I decided to rethink the scope and the story of my final project. While sticking to some of my original points of focus within LGTBQ rights that I learned about in the ILGA data, I am going to narrow the scope to focus on conversion therapy bans, or lack thereof, specifically in the United States. At first, I was focused on trying to create a story out of a single data set from ILGA and ended up with a vague storyline that was trying to do too much at once. An issue in LGBTQ rights that the ILGA data made me think about and want to research more on is the topic of conversion therapy, so I decided to broaden my research on on that subject to create a more specific narrative. The purpose of my project remains the same, but I believe a more specific story will be more engaging and lead to a stronger call to action.

One sentence summary: The United States has made strides in giving legal rights to LGBTQ+ citizens, but the LGBTQ+ community is still harmed and needs protection against conversion therapy.

Reader statement: As a reader, I want to know more about conversion therapy and how the United States needs to protect the LGBTQ+ community, so that I can advocate better for a federal ban against conversion therapy.

Call to action: Follow and donate to The Trevor Project, become a member of Born Perfect, and follow the ACLU and HRC campaigns for LGBTQ rights.

## Part II

### Wireframes/Storyboards

I utilized Balsamiq's wireframing tool to create my wireframes/storyboards. I used the wireframing elements to draft data visualizations, and I also included a visualization I had already created using Flourish. I built it out to really be a blueprint for when I transfer everything into Shorthand, including titles, subtitles, and text that tells the narrative alongside the visualizations. The PDF is attached below.

### User Research

To get feedback, I shared my wireframes/storyboards with a few classmates and received many helpful critiques from five different people. I sent them the wireframes/storyboards along with a Google form for them to anonymously respond to my questions. The ages of those that responded are between 20-35, and a couple of them also identify as LGBTQ. The target audience of my project is LGBTQ allies of all ages and backgrounds, but it was also important to me to see how the story resonated with those in the LGBTQ community as well.

|Goal                     |Questions Asked                                         |Feedback
|Emotional appeal         |What is your initial reaction to the story?             |The majority of respondents were shocked and worried about the reality regarding the detrimental effects of conversion therapy on LGBTQ youth. Some respondents were more familiar with the subject than others, but reported that they learned more about how wide spread the issue is and gained a new perspective.
|Clarity of narrative     |Does the flow of information make sense?                |Most respondents said the information was clear and the flow of the narrative made sense. One suggested that the timeline is moved to before or after the map so that the information about legislation is all together, and that the presentation begins with the problem. Another suggested that I use the map as a transition into the call to action by adding more direct text.
|Empowerment              |Would you take action after seeing this presentation? If so, is there a specific action you feel more drawn to?    |Respondents were more drawn to The Trevor Project and Born Perfect because of their missions specific towards LGBTQ youth; the majority also mentioned that they had not heard of Born Perfect before and were interested in that organization. Respondents that identify as LGBTQ were less compelled by HRC and ACLU because they are larger, broader organizations. One respondent noted their appreciation for the layout, placing more grassroots-funded organizations on top, and another suggested I guide the reader to the call of action best suited for them. 
|Complete information     |Is there any information you feel is left out, or unnecessary information that you would remove? |Most respondents skipped this question, but one suggested that I include information about states that may be considering legislation protecting LGBTQ youth from conversion therapy.
|Effective visualizations |Do you think the data visualizations aid the narrative? Is there anything you would change about them? |Nearly all respondents struggled with the visualization using icons of people to represent two different statistics, stating that it took them a significant amount of time to understand it. There was also some confusion with the bar graphs and what exact information was being compared. Two respondents also noted that they liked the consistency of the use of blue.

After reading through this feedback, it is evident to me that the narrative and message of my project is strong, but a couple of the visualizations definitely need some work. I plan to change the icon graph of people, probably splitting it into two different charts to show the two different statistics. I will also alter the side-by-side bar graph, changing a lot of its elements to make the information and visualization more clear. I will also consider rearranging some elements of the story, and at the very least fill out the subtitles and text to make the story more complete, and use callouts with text formatting to draw the readers attention to valuable information within that text.
