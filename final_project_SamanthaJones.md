# Final Project

## Part 1

### Outline

The data I am using focuses on the rights of LGBTI people across the world; which countries have laws protecting LGBTI people and various rights, as well as which countries have laws criminalizing LGBTI people for their sexual orientation. Part of the audience is LGBTI people, but I really want to focus on appealing to people who identify as or claim to be allies to the LGBTQIA community, but are not as educated on the subject of LGBTI human rights around the world. While this data covers information from many countries, I want to focus on the audience in the United States, and point out where the United States is both ahead of the curve with LGBTI protections and where it is falling behind. In the current political climate, I have found that many people want to educate themselves on marginalized groups and take more action to support those groups, but have a hard time confronting biases and pushing through personal barriers to really make change and be a true ally. As a member of the LGBTQ community, I am very passionate about the subject and interested in learning about these human rights on an international scale.

One sentence summary: There are many countries that still criminalize the LGBTI community and fail to protect it; the United States and others need more advocacy for human rights for this group.

Reader statement: As a reader, I want to know where in the world the LGBTI community are harmed, so that I can advocate better and support the cause.

Call to action: Use your voice to advocate for LGBTI rights in the United States and internationally, and if you can donate to organizations that support these efforts.

### Initial Sketches

### Data

The data source is The International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association, or [ILGA World](https://ilga.org/). I initially found this dataset through [Data World](https://data.world/dataforacause/lgbt-laws) and explored the data there. It is from 2017, and includes a variety of laws in 163 countries regarding protection, criminalization, recognition, and rights of LGBTI people across the world. More specifically, the data identifies countries where gay or lesbian relationships are illegal, where age of consent is unequal, where sexual acts are punishable at maximum sentences, where LGBTI people can be prosecuted for immorality up to a maximum sentence, how long maximum sentences are, whether or not human rights organizations are involved, where LGBTI marriage and adoption is recognized and legal, and where there are protections against conversion therapy, for employment, and against hate crimes. After doing more research into ILGA World, I found that they have datasets available for [2016, 2017, and 2019](https://ilga.org/maps-sexual-orientation-laws) as well as maps that visualize where there are stronger protections or more criminalization laws. I decided to stick with the 2017 data rather than the 2019 data because the way it is formatted, it is much easier to work with in Tableau, but I will reference the more recent dataset and look for changes too. Although the organization already has a variety of different maps to represent the data, I want to go further than that with other kinds of visualizations to tell the story and get the audience to my call to action. 

### Method and Medium

I plan to use Shorthand to create and format my final project as well as my final presentation. After looking through the data more in-depth, I will create more robust sketches and will likely use the Balsamiq wireframing tool, before going to Tableau to create my visualizations.
