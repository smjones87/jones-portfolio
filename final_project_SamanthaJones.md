# Final Project

## Part I

### Outline

The data I am using focuses on the rights of LGBTI people across the world; which countries have laws protecting LGBTI people and various rights, as well as which countries have laws criminalizing LGBTI people for their sexual orientation. Part of the audience is LGBTI people, but I really want to focus on appealing to people who identify as or claim to be allies to the LGBTQIA community, but are not as educated on the subject of LGBTI human rights around the world. While this data covers information from many countries, I want to focus on the audience in the United States, and point out where the United States is both ahead of the curve with LGBTI protections and where it is falling behind. The story arc will begin with highlighting legal protections that exist for the LGBTI community, then go down for what criminalizations exist, show where countries have and don't have these protections, then finally will show the audience how to advocate for more human rights protections. In the current political climate, I have found that many people want to educate themselves on marginalized groups and take more action to support those groups, but have a hard time confronting biases and pushing through personal barriers to really make change and be a true ally. As a member of the LGBTQ community, I am very passionate about the subject and interested in learning about these human rights on an international scale. 

One sentence summary: There are many countries that still criminalize the LGBTI community and fail to protect it; the United States and others need more advocacy for human rights for this group.

Reader statement: As a reader, I want to know where in the world the LGBTI community are harmed, so that I can advocate better and support the cause.

Call to action: Use your voice to advocate for LGBTI rights in the United States and internationally, and if you can, donate to organizations that support these efforts.

### Initial Sketches

![Maps](/initial_maps.jpg)
These maps are obviously inaccurate, but give a general idea of the main ideas in this data: where countries have enacted laws protecting the LGBTI community, and where countries have criminalized the LGBTI community. This is basically what ILGA World's own maps show, and the maps that I make will provide a starting place for the story.

![Charts](/initial_charts.jpg)
These charts are also inaccurate, but show how many opportunities there are in this dataset to show more specific comparisons and tell more specific and compelling stories. I am considering comparing specific helpful and harmful laws across the world, possibly divided by continents, and also showing a global picture of proportions of countres that have certain laws in place. I believe through creating individual visualizations for different points in the data, I will be able to tell a more robust story than I would with only maps.

### Data

The data source is The International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association, or [ILGA World](https://ilga.org/). I initially found [this dataset](ILGA_data.xlsx) through [Data World](https://data.world/dataforacause/lgbt-laws) and explored the data there. It is from 2017, and includes a variety of laws in 163 countries regarding protection, criminalization, recognition, and rights of LGBTI people across the world. More specifically, the data identifies countries where gay or lesbian relationships are illegal, where age of consent is unequal, where sexual acts are punishable at maximum sentences, where LGBTI people can be prosecuted for immorality up to a maximum sentence, how long maximum sentences are, whether or not human rights organizations are involved, where LGBTI marriage and adoption is recognized and legal, and where there are protections against conversion therapy, for employment, and against hate crimes. After doing more research into ILGA World, I found that they have datasets available for [2016, 2017, and 2019](https://ilga.org/maps-sexual-orientation-laws) as well as maps that visualize where there are stronger protections or more criminalization laws. I decided to stick with the 2017 data rather than the 2019 data because the way it is formatted, it is much easier to work with in Tableau, but I will reference the more recent dataset and look for changes too. Although the organization already has a variety of different maps to represent the data, I want to go further than that with other kinds of visualizations to tell the story and get the audience to my call to action. 

### Method and Medium

I plan to use Shorthand to create and format my final project as well as my final presentation. After looking through the data more in-depth, I will create more robust sketches and will likely use the Balsamiq wireframing tool, before going to Tableau to create my visualizations.

## Part I Revision

### Outline

After receiving feedback on Part I and working through Part II, I decided to rethink the scope and the story of my final project. While sticking to some of my original points of focus within LGTBQ rights that I learned about in the ILGA data, I am going to narrow the scope to focus on conversion therapy bans, or lack thereof, specifically in the United States. At first, I was focused on trying to create a story out of a single data set from ILGA and ended up with a vague storyline that was trying to do too much at once. An issue in LGBTQ rights that the ILGA data made me think about and want to research more on is the topic of conversion therapy, so I decided to broaden my research on on that subject to create a more specific narrative. The purpose of my project remains the same, but I believe a more specific story will be more engaging and lead to a stronger call to action.

One sentence summary: The United States has made strides in giving legal rights to LGBTQ+ citizens, but the LGBTQ+ community is still harmed and needs protection against conversion therapy.

Reader statement: As a reader, I want to know more about conversion therapy and how the United States needs to protect the LGBTQ+ community, so that I can advocate better for a federal ban against conversion therapy.

Call to action: Follow and donate to The Trevor Project, become a member of Born Perfect, and follow the ACLU and HRC campaigns for LGBTQ rights.

### Data

## Part II

### Wireframes/Storyboards

[Wireframes](Part II wireframes.pdf)

### User Research

To get feedback, I shared my wireframes/storyboards with a few classmates and received many helpful critiques from five different people. I sent them the wireframes/storyboards along with a Google form for them to anonymously respond to my questions. The ages of those that responded are between 20-35, and a couple of them also identify as LGBTQ. The target audience of my project is LGBTQ allies of all ages and backgrounds, but it was also important to me to see how the story resonated with those in the LGBTQ community as well.

|Goal                 |Questions Asked                                         |Feedback
|Emotional appeal     |What is your initial reaction to the story?             |The majority of respondents were shocked and worried about the reality regarding the detrimental effects of conversion therapy on LGBTQ youth. Some respondents were more familiar with the subject than others, but reported that they learned more about how wide spread the issue is and gained a new perspective.
|Clarity of narrative |Does the flow of information make sense?                |Most respondents said the information was clear and the flow of the narrative made sense. One suggested that the timeline is moved to before or after the map so that the information about legislation is all together, and that the presentation begins with the problem. Another suggested that I use the map as a transition into the call to action by adding more direct text.
|Empowerment          |Would you take action after seeing this presentation? If so, is there a specific action you feel more drawn to?    |Respondents were more drawn to The Trevor Project and Born Perfect because of their missions specific towards LGBTQ youth; the majority also mentioned that they had not heard of Born Perfect before and were interested in that organization. Respondents that identify as LGBTQ were less compelled by HRC and ACLU because they are larger, broader organizations. One respondent noted their appreciation for the layout, placing more grassroots-funded organizations on top, and another suggested I guide the reader to the call of action best suited for them. 

|Question                                           | Feedback
|                                                   | Conversion therapy needs to go!
|                                                   | It's affirming to see a reality I am well aware of reflected in the data, even if its a tragic reality.
|                                                   | This is both logical, but also terrifying.
|                                                   | I definitely knew about this issue myself, but did not know how wide spread it was or how linked it was to suicide attempts in LGBTQ youth. That was really shocking
|                                                   | This is a very strong story and you've put clear thought into what aspects to highlight here. Your story put things into better perspective for me and like how things flowed from history, to the problem, and then to the uptick at the end.
| Does the flow of information make sense?          | Yes. The flow 100% makes sense. I don't think anything needs to be rearranged
|                                                   | It does! Super clear.
|                                                   | No, I think the flow makes total sense!
|                                                   | I think it is fine the way it is but maybe you could consider starting with the problem so that people know what you are talking about and then moving the timeline to right before or after the map so that the information about legislation is all together.
|                                                   | Maybe you could use icons or some sort of callout text for the number of teens that will experience conversion therapy from doctors or religious figures. I would also maybe put this earlier while you are explaining the problem
|                                                   | I think you could still end on the map and say something like "We need this whole map to be blue, here's how you can help"
|                                                   | Your flow is very clear, so I wouldn't change anything there. (I appreciate that you've got the content warning at the top)
| Would you take action after seeing this presentation? If so, is there a specific action you feel more drawn to? | Born Perfect because it's so specific to this particular problem
|                                                                                                                 | I think so! I think at the very least I would follow these organizations. I think it might also be cool to include a petition or something concrete so people could feel that they are directly doing something to aid in passing anti-conversion therapy legislation.
|                                                  | Hard to say. Since I also identify as a member of the LGBTQ community, I already knew about 3/4 of the call to action links. I didn't know about Born Perfect which is a cool project! I'm wondering if maybe you could guide readers to the 1 or 2 resources that fit them and their knowledge base best?
|                                                  | Of the organizations listed, I am most drawn to the Trevor Project.
|                                                  | After seeing this, I would definitely be likely to take action. Personally, I think I'm more drawn to The Trevor Project because you talk about its focus on providing resources to those struggling with mental health. What I really like that you've done here with layout and design is placed what appear to be more grassroots organizations ahead of the larger, likely more well-funded ones.
| Is there any information you feel is left out, or unnecessary information that you would remove?    | If there are any states that are considering legislation to ban the practice, it would be interesting to see those listed.
| Do you think the data visualizations aid the narrative? Is there anything you would change about them? | They definitely do. Simple and straightforward.
|                                                  | it took me a significant amount of time to associate the "60%" statistic with the non greyed-out figures, and the "10%" with the blue figure. Maybe a more direct link about how those figures relate to the visualization would help make that point hit harder?
|                                                  | I don't completely understand the Suicide Attempt bar charts. I think it is challenging to make comparisons because they are sideways. The axes could also be more completely labeled
|                                                  | The first icon chart took me a second. I'd almost make two separate ones so that the distinction between 60% and 10% are clear. This might also be just a user error, because there's nothing incredibly confusing about this. Maybe shading them both blue? One lighter?
|                                                  |  For the chart using people icons, it's a bit unclear at first that the blue one is part of the initial 60%, so consider including something that helps indicate that from a first glance.
|                                                  | For the bar chart below that, I like where you're going with it, it just took me a moment to realize that they were looking at two similar, but different categories. Maybe consider changing up the color scheme there to heighten the differences between "attempt to convince or change" and "conversion therapy"? I'm not sure added titles would help here, as I like the way you've got them currently. Maybe also try putting them on the same chart by hierarchy since they address the same issue? 
| Final thoughts or suggestions?                   | Consistency of the use of blue really helps! This is an important topic. I'm excited to see it finished. For any of the data buried in text, I think maybe some call-outs will help as well. I wouldn't want to miss anything!
|                                                  | Thank you for including the content warning at the beginning! The use of blue throughout is really nice.

After reading through this feedback, it is evident to me that the narrative and message of my project is strong, but a couple of the visualizations definitely need some work. I plan to change the icon graph of people, probably splitting it into two different charts to show the two different statistics. I will also significantly alter the side-by-side bar graph, changing a lot of its elements to make the information and visualization more clear. I will also consider rearranging some elements of the story, and at the very least fill out the subtitles and text to make the story more complete.
